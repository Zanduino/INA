 @brief Example program for the INA Library demonstrating reading an INA device and displaying
 results

 @section DisplayReadings_section Description

 Program to demonstrate the INA library for the Arduino. When started, the library searches the
 I2C bus for all INA2xx devices. Then the example program goes into an infinite loop and displays
 the power measurements (bus voltage and current) for all devices.\n\n

 Detailed documentation can be found on the GitHub Wiki pages at
 https://github.com/Zanduino/INA/wiki \n\n This example is for a INA set up to measure a 5-Volt
 load with a 0.1 Ohm resistor in place, this is the same setup that can be found in the Adafruit
 INA219 breakout board.  The complex calibration options are done at runtime using the 2
 parameters specified in the "begin()" call and the library has gone to great lengths to avoid the
 use of floating point to conserve space and minimize runtime.  This demo program uses floating
 point only to convert and display the data conveniently. The INA devices have 15 bits of
 precision, and even though the current and watt information is returned using 32-bit integers the
 precision remains the same.\n\n

 The library supports multiple INA devices and multiple INA device types. The Atmel's EEPROM is
 used to store the 96 bytes of static information per device using
 https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/EEPROM function calls. Although up to 16 devices could
 theoretically be present on the I2C bus the actual limit is determined by the available EEPROM -
 ATmega328 UNO has 1024k so can support up to 10 devices but the ATmega168 only has 512 bytes
 which limits it to supporting at most 5 INAs. Support has been added for the ESP32 based
 Arduinos, these use the EEPROM calls differently and need specific code.
